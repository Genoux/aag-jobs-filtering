## Processing Rules

### 1. Title Standardization
a) Format Requirements:
- Pattern: [Specialty] Physician at [Company] [City]
- Remove all quotes and special characters
- Standardize medical terms
- Always include "Physician" in the title unless it's clearly a different role (like "Nurse Practitioner" or "Physician Assistant")

### 2. Category Assignment
- Match to exact specialty name from list above
- Do not add variations or new categories
- Use "Other" for:
  * Multiple possible matches
  * Non-medical positions
  * Administrative roles
  * Unclear specialties
  * Any other category that does not fit the above

### 3. CRITICAL Field Preservation Rules

   - job_type (keep exactly as provided)
   - uniq_id (MUST keep exactly as provided)
2. Only modify:
   - job_title (standardize format)
   - category (match to specialty list)

### 4. Duplicate Detection & PT/FT Handling
Step 1: Remove all PT/FT markers initially
Step 2: Compare exact matches of:
- Function
- Company
- Location
Step 3: For duplicates only (To differentiate between full-time and part-time positions):
- Add (PT) for part-time positions
- Add (FT) for full-time positions
Step 4: Leave unique positions without PT/FT

## Output Requirements
